# Contributing to the Tenki Cookbook

This is the examples/cookbook layer for Tenki, and this is your playbook. New here? Read this top to bottom once, then you're set.

## Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Get a Tenki account + key.** Install the CLI and run `tenki login` — it writes your token and default project/workspace to `~/.config/tenki/config.yaml`. The examples read from there automatically.
2. **Node 20+.**
3. **Run an example to confirm your setup works:**
   ```bash
   cd examples/run-code-in-a-sandbox
   npm install
   node verify.mjs        # ✓ create → exec python3 → 42 → dispose
   ```
   If that prints a ✓, you're ready.

## The one rule (non-negotiable)

**Every example runs on Tenki and proves it in CI.** A public example that doesn't work damages the brand more than a missing one helps.

- Each example ships a **`verify.mjs`** that exercises it against the live Tenki API and **exits non-zero on any failure**.
- CI (`.github/workflows/verify.yml`) runs every `verify.mjs` with a `TENKI_API_KEY` secret. A red build blocks the merge.
- `verify.mjs` proves the *Tenki-facing* part. If an example needs an LLM (an agent turn), verify the tool/backend against Tenki directly — don't require a model key in CI. (See `langchain-code-interpreter` and `eve-agent-on-tenki` for the pattern.)

## What to build

The full backlog, ranked, is in **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)**. Start with the **Start here** list. Each item names the shipped example to copy the pattern from.

## Anatomy of an example

```
examples/<name>/
  README.md        # the tutorial — what it does, the whole integration, how to run
  package.json     # deps ("type": "module")
  verify.mjs       # CI-runnable proof it works against Tenki
  <code>           # the example itself (a script, agent/, tool + agent, …)
```

`verify.mjs` reads the token from `TENKI_AUTH_TOKEN` / `TENKI_API_KEY` (CI) or `~/.config/tenki/config.yaml` (local), drives the Tenki-facing code, asserts the result, and cleans up any sandbox it created. Keep it under ~60 lines. Copy one from a shipped example.

**Which template to copy:**
- Direct SDK use → **`run-code-in-a-sandbox`**
- A framework agent + a code-execution tool → **`langchain-code-interpreter`**
- A pluggable sandbox backend for a framework → **`eve-agent-on-tenki`**

## Adding an example — step by step

1. `cp -r` the closest template to `examples/<your-name>/`.
2. Swap in your code; keep it to one clear thing.
3. Write `verify.mjs` — assert the Tenki-facing result, clean up.
4. Run it: `node verify.mjs` → must print ✓.
5. Write the `README.md` (the tutorial) — link back to `tenki.cloud`, name the products used.
6. Add a row to the repo `README.md` examples table and flip its status in `ROADMAP.md`.
7. Open the PR. CI runs your `verify.mjs`.
8. Write the companion article (the example is the code; the article is the walkthrough).

## Style

- **Short and runnable beats comprehensive.** One clear thing per example.
- Name the Tenki products used; link back to `tenki.cloud`.
- Tenki confines file I/O to `/home/tenki` — use relative paths.
- Note any gotchas inline (e.g. `exec(cmd, { args })` doesn't shell-split; `allowOutbound: true` is needed for network).

## Review flow

Draft → content review (+ an engineer spot-checks technical accuracy) → publish. Then pick the next item off [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and ship it.
