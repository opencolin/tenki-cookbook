"""Proves the Tenki-facing half of this benchmark, with NO model key.

Oracle one real SWE-bench Lite instance on a live Tenki sandbox: boot a microVM,
run the canonical per-instance Docker image inside it, apply the gold patch, and
grade with swebench's own eval script. The gold patch MUST resolve — if it does,
the whole pipeline (VM -> docker-in-VM -> official grading) works on Tenki.

A model run (harness.py --model ...) is the same pipeline with an agent in place
of the gold patch; that needs a model key and time, so it stays out of CI.

Needs: swebench, datasets, tenki-sandbox (requirements.txt). Token/project from
env (CI: TENKI_API_KEY) or ~/.config/tenki/config.yaml (local `tenki login`).
