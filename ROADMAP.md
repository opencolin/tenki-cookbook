# Cookbook roadmap

The backlog of examples, ranked and categorized. Pick the next thing off **Start here**, or grab anything below. Every example is also a companion article (the example is the canonical code; the article is the walkthrough).

**Before you start:** read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — setup, the anatomy of an example, and the one rule (**every example runs on Tenki and proves it in `verify.mjs`, which CI gates on**).

## Legend
- ✅ done · 🔜 next (self-contained, build now) · 📋 backlog
- **Template** = the shipped example to copy the pattern from:
  - `run-code-in-a-sandbox` — direct SDK use (`@tenkicloud/sandbox`)
  - `langchain-code-interpreter` — a framework agent + a code-execution tool
  - `eve-agent-on-tenki` — a pluggable sandbox backend for a framework

## Start here (recommended order)
The highest-value next examples. Ranked by reach × fit × effort (validated Jul 21 — see [Sourcing note](#sourcing-note-jul-21)).

| # | Example | Why | Template |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **⭐ Vercel AI SDK + Tenki** | 25.7k★ — THE TypeScript AI toolkit. Its `experimental_sandbox` wants the **same run/spawn/file interface `tenki-eve-sandbox` already implements** → a thin adapter, not a rebuild. Biggest reach, least new code. | `eve-agent-on-tenki` (same interface) |
| 2 | **LangChain code interpreter (Python)** | LangChain's biggest audience is Python; mirror the JS one | `langchain-code-interpreter` (port to Python) |
| ~~3~~ | ~~**smolagents + Tenki**~~ | ✅ **shipped** → `smolagents` (a Tenki `RemotePythonExecutor` on the `remote_executors.py` seam) | done |
| ~~4~~ | ~~**CrewAI + Tenki**~~ | ✅ **shipped** → `crewai-code-interpreter` (55.9k★; a crew that runs code in a Tenki sandbox) | done |
| 5 | **E2B → Tenki migration guide** | Arms the Startup-Program switcher pitch; side-by-side code | `run-code-in-a-sandbox` |
| 6 | **Runners quickstart** | The one-line CI swap; a sample workflow file | new (docs + workflow) |
| 7 | **OpenHands runtime (bigger lift)** | 81.6k★ — the open coding agent. A Tenki Runtime alongside its Docker/E2B/Daytona/Modal. Highest reach of all, but real work (Python runtime impl). | new |

### Migration guides
*"Here's your E2B/Modal/Daytona code, here's the Tenki equivalent" + a mapping table + the switcher pitch. Feeds the Startup-Program switcher campaign.*

## Sourcing note (Jul 21)
How candidates get onto this list — and how they get rejected:

- **The fit test first:** does the project's agent *write/run code* that benefits from a disposable microVM? If it only calls APIs (payments, CRM, email), a sandbox adds nothing — skip it. (This is why a batch of Hermes *business*-hackathon winners was rejected — see `built-on-tenki`.)
- **Then validate the seam + reach** (don't add names on faith): confirm the framework has a real executor/sandbox plug-point, and check stars/recency. Findings this round:
  - **⭐ Vercel AI SDK** (25.7k★, pushed daily) — the highest-leverage add we were missing. Its `experimental_sandbox` takes the *same* run/spawn/file interface `tenki-eve-sandbox` already implements → most reach, least new code. **Build next.**
  - **OpenHands** (81.6k★) — the biggest open coding agent; a pluggable `Runtime`. Highest ceiling, bigger lift.
  - **smolagents** (28.5k★) — `remote_executors.py` (E2B/Docker) confirmed as the seam; small PR.
  - **CrewAI** (55.9k★), **AutoGen/ag2** (60k★ brand) — real code-executor seams.
  - **Papermill** (6.5k★) — opens the data-science/notebook lane.
- **Rejected / low-priority:** Aider (47.6k★ but runs locally — no clean pluggable-sandbox seam) · Qwen-Agent (has a code interpreter but ~4 months stale). Reach without a seam ≠ a good example.

## Notes & dependencies
- **`langchain-code-interpreter`, `run-code-in-a-sandbox`** use only published packages (LangChain + `@tenkicloud/sandbox`) — self-contained, work today.
- **`eve-agent-on-tenki`** and the **MCP** example install `tenki-eve-sandbox` / `tenki-mcp`, which are on GitHub but **not yet on npm** — those go fully `npm install`-clean (and green in CI) once we publish.
- **`composio-tenki`** installs clean (all three deps — `@composio/core`, `@tenkicloud/composio-tools`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk` — are on npm), but its `verify.mjs` needs **`COMPOSIO_API_KEY`** as a CI secret in addition to the Tenki token. Wire that secret before it goes green.
- **Python examples** need the CI harness extended to run `verify.py` (currently Node-only) — small change to `scripts/run-all.mjs` + the workflow. Flag it in the first Python PR.
- Anything needing the network (`pip install`, scraping) needs `allowOutbound: true` at create — note it in the example.
